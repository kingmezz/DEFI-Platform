# Stacks DeFi Platform Smart Contract

A comprehensive decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. This platform implements advanced DeFi features including lending, borrowing, staking, flash loans, and governance mechanisms.

## Features

### Core Financial Services
- **Lending & Borrowing**
  - Multi-asset lending pools
  - Collateralized borrowing
  - Dynamic interest rates
  - Automated collateral ratio maintenance

- **Staking**
  - Multiple staking pools
  - Time-weighted rewards
  - Flexible staking periods
  - Automated reward distribution

- **Flash Loans**
  - Instant uncollateralized loans
  - Single-transaction execution
  - Built-in security validations
  - Automatic fee collection

### Governance
- Proposal creation and voting
- Token-weighted voting system
- Automated proposal execution
- Community-driven parameter updates

### Risk Management
- Liquidation mechanisms
- Collateral ratio monitoring
- Dynamic interest rate adjustment
- Emergency pause functionality

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **User Management**
```clarity
(define-map user-balances 
    principal 
    {
        deposited: uint,
        borrowed: uint,
        collateral: uint,
        staked: uint,
        rewards: uint,
        governance-tokens: uint,
        last-reward-claim: uint
    }
)
```

2. **Lending Pools**
```clarity
(define-map lending-pools 
    (string-ascii 32) 
    {
        total-supplied: uint,
        total-borrowed: uint,
        interest-rate: uint,
        collateral-factor: uint,
        reward-rate: uint,
        last-update-time: uint
    }
)
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain environment
- Clarity CLI tools
- Node.js and npm (for testing)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stacks-defi-platform.git
cd stacks-defi-platform
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Deploy the contract
```bash
clarinet contract deploy
```

## Usage Examples

### Depositing Tokens
```clarity
(contract-call? .defi-platform deposit u1000 "STX")
```

### Creating a Flash Loan
```clarity
(contract-call? .defi-platform flash-loan "STX" u1000 tx-sender callback-contract)
```

### Staking Tokens
```clarity
(contract-call? .defi-platform stake u1000 "STAKE-POOL-1")
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Flash Loan Security**
   - All operations must complete in a single transaction
   - Implement proper callback validation
   - Verify token balances before and after operations

2. **Collateral Management**
   - Maintain minimum collateral ratio
   - Implement gradual liquidation mechanisms
   - Regular collateral value updates

3. **Access Control**
   - Function-level authorization checks
   - Admin-only sensitive operations
   - Emergency pause mechanisms

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
clarinet test
```

Key test files:
- `test/lending.test.ts`
- `test/flash-loans.test.ts`
- `test/governance.test.ts`

## Contract Deployment

### Mainnet
1. Update configuration in `settings/Mainnet.toml`
2. Deploy using Clarinet:
```bash
clarinet deploy --network mainnet
```

### Testnet
```bash
clarinet deploy --network testnet
```
